// Finding the Perimeter of a rectangle

var rectangle= [6,4,9];  //this is my array of numbers you can choose from. I choose rectangle

var length= parseInt(prompt("Please enter one number 6,4,9 for the length"));
var width= parseInt(prompt("Please enter one number 6 4,9 for the width"));

var total= (2* (length * width)); // this is the formula to find the perimeter of a rectangle

console.log("The length of the rectangle is " +length+ " and the width of the rectangle is " +width+ " thus the total perimeter of the rectangle is " +total);
// above is my concatenation and answer.
