//Basic while loops

//the while loop, loops through a block of code as long as a condition is true

// var i=0;
//while(conditional){
//
//code that runs while condition is true
//incremental change to the counting
//variable OR infinite loop
//
//
//}

var counter=0;  //Initializing counter

while (counter<20) {
    //code that will run as long as counter <20
    console.log(counter+" Some things just never change");
    
    //change for the counter variable
    counter++;
}


//Do while loop
//The code will run at least once before checking the condition.


var i=0; //staring counter

do{
    //this code will run before the condition is checked
    // it will also run as long at the the condition is true
    console.log("The number is " +i);
    
    i++;
}while (i<10);
